# Hire Lemon

This repo is all the up-to-date code for the Hire Lemon portfolio site, available at [HireLemon.com](http://hirelemon.com). Everything here is custom to the site. I am using [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) but I pretty much am always using jQuery.

The Favico stack here was made with [Real Favicon Generator](http://realfavicongenerator.net/) by [Phillipe Bernard](https://github.com/phbernard).

That's about the extent of it. I'm always taking freelance work.
