          <p>The F Plus is a long running podcast in need of a snappy and intelligently designed website which can support the content provided by the podcast as well as the contributions from its extensive community.</p>
          <h3>Start over, rebuild it all.</h3>
          <p>In 2014, the initial podcast website (built in 2009) was straining under the weight of content it was never built to maintain. A new system had to be created tailored to the content of the site. We needed something modular, content driven, fully responsive, and as fast has humanly possible.</p><img src="img/case-studies/thefplus/edit-episode.jpg" class="shot"/>
          <p>Choosing the CMS came first. We wanted something lightweight and easy to understand. We gave a look to <a href="http://monstra.org/">Monstra</a>, <a href="https://octobercms.com/">October</a>, and <a href="http://www.razorcms.co.uk/">Razor</a> before finally landing on <a href="http://getkirby">Kirby</a> as our CMS solution.</p>
          <p>Kirby is flat-file based, meaning it doesn't interact with a database, so the site can render on any pivot point incredibly fast. Managing a piece of content is just a matter of managing the simple text file that controls that piece of content.</p>
          <p>Each type of content has been created specificaly for the site, and all necessary data can be edited in a backend panel. As this data changes and grows, so does the site, and the #1 issue with the old site (maintainability) has been resolved. As a bonus, the clever use of markdown has made the new site incredibly easy to update, so work can be done much, much faster.</p>
          <h3>Whatever the screen, content still comes first.</h3><img src="img/case-studies/thefplus/multimonitor.jpg" class="shot"/>
          <p>The site responds heroically to all browser resolutions, due to technology like <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">flexbox</a>, but also because the design is in service of the content. When you start with an enthusiastic fanbase, you know what people are looking for, and you have a better idea on how to service them. </p>
          <p>To that end, the page templates were built from the ground up to service the content they'd hold, while adjusting display of those templates based on the screen they're being rendered on.</p>
          <p>There's no concept of an internal content holder on the website, whatever screen you have, the site is going to use it, without framing devices or repeating backgrounds.</p>
          <h3>A satasfying design, some helpful lessons,</h3>
          <p>Success can be measured in a number of different ways with this project: Traffic has increased, listenership has gone up, adding content takes less than a quarter of the time it used to, and managing user interactions is a simpler and more enjoyable process. But the other thing that makes this site a success for me is the knowledge I've walked away with.</p>
          <p>There's a lot more popular CMS solutions than Kirby out there (I've used a bunch of them), but using something so common and mature means doing a lot of retrofitting to get this broad piece of software to do the specific thing you want. Shortcuts are tempting, the code written can be embarassing.</p>
          <p>None of this was the case here. Everything in the code is there because it's reflected on the site, and when I wanted the site to do something that wasn't in the code, I had to figure out how to get it in there. And it's that kind of thing that makes me feel like a better programmer when I'm done.</p>

          <p>Akwesasne Mohawk casino in upstate New York had a website that didn't fit their casino.
